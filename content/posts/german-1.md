# Intro
I have been pretty lazy in posting here in this blog. In order to post more often and enrich my memories and skills, I have decided to start writing about my Deutsch learning progress. Right now I'm following a course on Preply but I also use Babbel for learning german. I am also reading a book (Cafe in Berlin by André Klein).

# German #1: Simple Zeitformen
On Preply (thanks, Stefanie! 😊) I have been studying Zeitformen (verb tenses). Every verb in german has at least these three Zeitformen which are important to learn (e.g. fahren):
- Infinitiv: fahren
- Präteritum: fuhr
- Partizip II: gefahren

There are other Zeitformen, but for now I'm sticking to these three (one thing at a time 😮‍💨)


They are a pain to learn because all verbs behave in their own way of behaving when we need to build their various Zeitformen:
## Regular verbs
Exampels of regular verbs: **lernen**/**spielen** (learning/playing)
- lernen/lernte/gelernt
- spielen/spielte/gespielt
Standard endings are added to the verbs: -en/-te/-t
## Non-regular verbs
These are the fun ones of course because we need to learn by heart... ffs

"Fortunately" we can divide them into three categories:
### ABA
The letters indicate what happens in the middle of the verb, for example:
- f**a**hren/f**u**hr/gef**a**hren
You can see that the letter in the middle (a/u/a) changes only for the Präteritum, the Partizip II returns to being the same as the Infinitiv

Other examples:
- essen/aß/gegessen
- fallen/fiel/gefallen

and many more (just learn them, lol)

### ABB
Following the same concept as before, here's an example:
- bl**ei**ben/bl**ie**b/gebl**ie**ben (ei/ie/ie)
- biegen/bog/gebogen (ie/o/o)

we can spot the pattern by noticing that for the Präteritum and the Partizip II, the letters in the middle stay the same, even though it's not straightforward how to build them (bog and gebogen are wildly different even though they share the same middle o)
### ABC
These are the funnier ones because they are all different:
- f**i**nden/f**a**nd/gef**u**nden (i/a/u)
At first I though there was a paattern of (i/a/u) always, but that's not necessarily the case, for example here's another verb:
- gewinnen/gewann/gewonnen (i/a/o)

It is different, and I feel like there's an intuition that needs to be built just by practicing, I think that there needs to be a balance between finding shortcuts and memorizing, considering the fact that if the shortcuts become too many and too complex, it's just not worth the tradeoff... it's easier to just build an intuition and learn them by heart at a certain point
# das Ende
This is it for now, until the next time.
I have made a ruby script for memorizing these words as I study along https://github.com/atipijasin/german-tools/tree/main/zeitformen
